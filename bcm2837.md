> If you open the manual we’ve linked you to, you’ll see references to the BCM2835 chip everywhere. This is because we’ve simply taken the documentation for the BCM2835 chip, fixed relevant errata, and fixed the title to say BCM2837.
> The BCM2837 and BCM2835 share the same peripherals with the same relative memory-mapped interfaces. The main difference is that the chips differ in their physical memory configuration. This results in the BCM2837 having a peripheral physical base address of 0x3F000000 as opposed to the BCM2835’s 0x20000000. But both chips map this range to the peripheral base address of 0x7E000000. In short, a peripheral address 0x7EXXXXXX is at physical address 0x3FXXXXXX on the BCM2837. The “BCM2837” documentation we’ve linked to contains this change.
